# Store Management (using SQL)
To develop sales management web application for a wholesale business to improve the efficiency and security of the business. The lightweight nature of the web application makes it ideal for small businesses which cannot afford the expensive alternates present in the market.

# Background
More and more businesses are moving towards to digitalized systems and small business owners cannot afford very expensive CRS systems in the market sso we aimed to create a system most suitable to them and their traditional style of manually entering data.

# Project Specifics
The management system has multiple features each connected and integrated with our database that has customer details and much more which is required by small business owners.

# Problem Analysis
The overall problem for this project was to create an environment for the business owner to not feel overwhelmed by the usual look of database entry and make it user friendly for them to enter and access info based on the database info such as their profit etc.
We did this by including a front-end built with HTML and CSS and making it user friendly and straightforward to use with validations where possible.

We used PHP for integrating HTML/CSS with our database which was based on MySql and was tested using XAMPP.

# Future Work/Recommendations
To create a functional customer-end and make it a web based application so both customer and store management can efficiently use the website.
